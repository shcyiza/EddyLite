# Eddy Lite 🎵🎵💰

This is my take-home project for Eddy the leading royalty management company.

## how to run the project
Install gem dependencies:

```$ bundle install```

Create the DB:

```$ rake db:create```

Migrate the code:

```$ rake db:migrate```

Run the seeds:

```$ rake db:seed```

The data given by the assignment located in the ```/assignment-files```  directory is seeded.

Last step is to install the front-end dependencies with web-packer

```$ yarn install``` or ```$ rake npm install```

You should be good to launch de dev server now: ```$ rails s``` at ```http://localhost:3000/```

## Tech used
- Rails 6
- Vue.js integrated with web-packer

## What I would have done with more time:

* Integrate Chart JS

* Make view details of a track with releases, revenue and shares
